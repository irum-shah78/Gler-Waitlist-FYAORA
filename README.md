## Usage

### Filtering Service Providers
1. Use the sidebar filters to narrow down results:
   - **Postcode**: Enter UK postcode (e.g., "SW1A 1AA")
   - **Registration Status**: Select "Onboarded" or "Rejected"
   - **Date Range**: Set start and end dates (MM/DD/YYYY format)
   - **Vendor Type**: Choose "Independent" or "Company"
   - **Service Offering**: Select from "Housekeeping", "Window Cleaning", or "Car Valet"

2. Click "Filter" to apply filters or "Clear Filters" to reset

### Searching
- Use the search bar in the top-right to search across all fields
- Search is case-insensitive and works with partial matches

### Managing Providers
1. **Select Providers**: Use checkboxes to select individual providers or "Select All"
2. **View Details**: Click the edit icon to open the provider details modal
3. **Actions**: In the modal, you can onboard or reject providers
4. **Edit Notes**: Click "Edit" next to Internal Notes to modify provider notes

### Sorting
- Click any column header to sort by that field
- Click again to reverse the sort order
- Sort indicators (↑↓) show the current sort direction

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
The application uses React's built-in state management with `useState` and `useMemo` for efficient re-rendering and filtering.

### Data Flow
1. Sample data is loaded from `src/data/sampleData.ts`
2. Filters and search query are applied using utility functions
3. Data is sorted and paginated before rendering
4. User interactions update state and trigger re-renders

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memoized Filtering**: Expensive filter operations are memoized with `useMemo`
- **Efficient Sorting**: Custom sorting algorithm handles different data types
- **Pagination**: Only renders visible items to improve performance
- **Responsive Images**: Optimized for different screen sizes

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactive elements
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Color Contrast**: Meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards

## Customization

### Styling
The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling. Key customization points:
- Colors: Defined in `tailwind.config.ts`
- Components: Styled in individual component files
- Animations: Custom animations in `globals.css`

### Adding New Filters
1. Add new filter to `FilterState` type in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Add filter component to `Sidebar.tsx`
3. Update filtering logic in `src/lib/utils.ts`

### Modifying Data Structure
1. Update `ServiceProvider` interface in `src/types/index.ts`
2. Modify sample data in `src/data/sampleData.ts`
3. Update table columns and mobile cards in `Table.tsx`

## Browser Support
